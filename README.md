# Edabit Scraper

## Quickstart

If you just want only the info, feel free to use the `ut_*.json` files, which contains the updated exercises until August 10th 2020.
The complete one with all of the sections is the `ut_merged_list.json`.

If you want to know how we did each step, see the following sections.

## 1. Scrap

All needed to scrap can be found inside `./scraper`

## 2. Upload to a DB

All needed to upload can be found inside `./uploader`
